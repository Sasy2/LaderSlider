# Calculus Ladder Problem - GeoGebra Visualization

## Overview
This project is a dynamic and visual exploration of a classic **related rates problem** in Calculus involving a ladder sliding down a wall. It leverages **GeoGebra** to model, visualize, and analyze how the horizontal distance, vertical height, and angle change over time.

### 📐 Problem Context
A ladder of length 15 ft slides down a vertical wall. The bottom of the ladder moves horizontally at a constant speed of 4 ft/sec. The project models how the height of the ladder on the wall and the angle it makes with the ground change with time.
